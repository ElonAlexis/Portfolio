        ArcadiaVR, as the name implies, is an arcade world/environment setup in Virtual Reality.
        <br><br>
        It contains a mixture of retro arcade games which are set up in the main VR environment as well as 2 original (created by me) VR games which the player
        can navigate to while playing.
        <br><br>
        
        
        *Due to it being in VR, certain mechanics could not be recorded as well as if it were a regular 3D game, so i will try
        my best to explain the games individually. Links to each part will be included below.
        <br><br>
        
        
        The game is divided into 3 sections, the first being the actual arcade space. The other sections are the two other
        original games I created (Shadow Arena, Nano Aggression ).
