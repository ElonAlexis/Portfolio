            Shadow Arena was my version of a VR zombie game, except the choice of weapon was a bow & arrow. I thought that having a
            bow & arrow would be very interesting to play with in VR instead of guns which you see in many other games. I did plan
            to include other weapons, but due to time restrictions was unable to do so.

            <span class="minigames" style="color: #c70000">Objective</span>
    
            <br><br>
            The objective of this game is to simply get as high a score as possible by killing the zombies (which spawn in waves).
            It was designed in such a way that players are somewhat forced to be active and aggressive, because the players health
            starts decreasing when inactive or avoiding enemies. In order to keep alive and keep the health bar up, the player must
            get kills (multiple kills with the grenade don't count as grenades would only be used to get out of sticky situations).
            <br><br>
            I also wanted to find a way to display the players health without taking up any of the screen, so i decided to use the
            Bow's string as a health bar, that way it is always visible, and the score tracker is just above the bow's top.
