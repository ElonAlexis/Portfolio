            FreezyFall is my first fully published game and It's a vertical endless runner!
            <br>
            <br>
            The player is an ice cube
            falling with simple tap controls. He can land on the platforms that are rising from below but needs to continue his descent to avoid getting
            spiked.        
            ​<br>
            ​<br>
            The objective is to get the highest score possible and collect enough coins to unlock the characters available in the store 
            <br>
            ​<br>        
            This was also my first attempt at drawing and animating everything from scratch; basic characters and assets, using
            photoshop, scratch, and other tools I found useful.
