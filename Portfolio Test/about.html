            Thank you for taking the time to find out more about me personally!
            <br>
        
            <br>        
            My name is Elon Alexis and I currently reside in London. I am an absolute tech-head and i'm
            constantly in pursuit of the latest technology, gadgets, really anything tech i can get my hands on. I am also an
            avid PC gamer / enthusiast. I learnt how to build/troubleshoot computers from an early age and have built quite a few in the past and im constantly upgrading my current build!
            <br>
            
            <br>    
            Outside of my tech abilities, i'm a musician. I play the guitar and was previously in a band where I was lead
            guitarist. I also dabble in visual art, i draw cartoon characters or scenery free
            hand
            (not the best looking if i may add haha) but I try!​
            <br>
            
            <br>
            I love customization, making everything I own..." Mine" and unique through use of skins, stickers or throwing RGB
            into
            the equation to give all my gadgets a little character!
