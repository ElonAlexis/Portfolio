            Scope(Coded in Typescript) - The player starts off with an initial bet value. The player then spins the wheel and gets a random number.
            The
            safe box with the random number on the front is then opened revealing a prize multiplier. The player spins a MAX of
            3
            additional times until two of the multipliers are identical. When the two multipliers are unlocked, the initial bet
            value is then multiplied by this multiplier and the player claims his prize!
